# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions


This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using various techniques, including data collection, data preprocessing, generating new data using large language models (LLMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning models, and MLOps. The end goal is to create a robust framework for identifying potential fraud in financial transactions using machine learning models and other advanced techniques.

**Project Overview**

The project is structured into five main stages:

**1-Data Collection**

**2-Data Preprocessing**

**3-Data Augmentation & Generation**

**4-Machine Learning and MLOps**

**5-Model Evaluation, Analysis, and Statistics**

**1. Data Collection**

The dataset used in this project is based on the **PaySim** simulator, which simulates mobile money transactions from real-world financial logs. PaySim is based on real financial data extracted over one month from a mobile money service in an African country. The dataset used is a synthetic version of the real logs, scaled down to 1/4th of the original size for computational efficiency. The original dataset is provided by a multinational mobile financial service company operating in over 14 countries.

**Dataset Source**: [PaySim Financial Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1)

This dataset contains various types of transactions, including PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, and more, with columns representing transaction amounts, origin and destination balances, and whether the transaction was fraudulent.

**2. Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing is essential to prepare the dataset for training machine learning models. The following steps were taken during preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Checking for and addressing missing values to ensure data integrity.
Categorical Encoding: Converting categorical columns (e.g., transaction types) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Applying feature scaling (normalization or standardization) to the numerical columns to enhance model performance.
Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
**3. Data Augmentation & Generation**

To enrich the dataset and create more diverse examples for training and testing, we employed two key techniques:

**1-Large Language Models (LLMs)**:

We used pre-trained GPT-2 models to generate text descriptions of transactions. Each transaction is described in detail, highlighting the transaction type, amount, and balances involved. These descriptions provide additional context and can be used in NLP-based fraud detection models.

**2-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:

We used GANs to generate synthetic data for augmenting the dataset. GANs allow us to create realistic data that can be used to test the robustness of our fraud detection models. This technique ensures that the models can generalize well to unseen fraudulent cases.

**4. Machine Learning and MLOps**

Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were applied to detect fraudulent transactions, including:

**Logistic Regression**: 
A simple baseline model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

**Random Forest Classifier**: 
A more advanced model that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

**XGBoost**:
A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that performs well in fraud detection tasks.

**Neural Networks**: 
Deep learning models were employed for more complex patterns in the data.
We evaluated these models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**MLOps**
In the MLOps stage, we focused on operationalizing our machine learning workflows:

**Model Deployment**: 
The trained models were deployed using platforms such as AWS Sagemaker or TensorFlow Serving.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Ensured continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automatically testing and updating the models when new data or features are introduced.
Monitoring: Models were monitored for performance drift over time, ensuring that they remain effective at fraud detection as new transactions are processed.

**5. Model Evaluation, Analysis, and Statistics**
After training and deploying our models, we performed detailed analysis and evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in detecting fraud. Key steps include:

**Confusion Matrix**:
To understand the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for fraud detection.

**Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: 
Precision and recall are critical in fraud detection, as they measure the ability of the model to minimize false positives and false negatives.

**ROC Curve and AUC**: 
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) provide insights into model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets like fraud detection.

**Statistical Analysis**: 
We performed additional statistical analysis to understand the patterns and anomalies in the dataset and to identify key features that impact fraud detection.

**5-Project Workflow**

**1-Data Collection:**
Acquiring the dataset from Kaggle.

**2-Data Preprocessing:** 
Cleaning, encoding, scaling, and splitting the dataset for training.

**3-Data Augmentation:**
Generating additional data using GPT-2 for NLP-based analysis. Creating synthetic data using GANs for robust testing.

**4-Model Training:** 
Training several machine learning models and deep learning architectures to detect fraudulent transactions.

**6-MLOps:** 
Implementing CI/CD pipelines, model monitoring, and deployment.

**Evaluation & Analysis:** Evaluating model performance using classification metrics and performing statistical analysis on results.
